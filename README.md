#### Project Description: 
As part of the Web 3.0 evolution, NFT has become a popular topic for tech enthusiasts to discuss and invest in. With the NFT trend proliferating, mosaic art style images have become a fashion for people to use as their profile photos for their social media accounts. 

For this project, I was interested in constructing a website that provides functionality for users to upload their images and convert their pictures to mosaic art-style images. Aside from converting the images, the website also provides users with options to download the image or post the image on the online mosaic art style image community to share with other users and comment under the posts.

The website has an Oauth Login page for new users to log in with their Google accounts. In addition, an image conversion page converts the user-uploaded images to mosaic art-style pictures. And also a community page where users can post and comment on others' posts. On my profile page, users can check the total likes and dislikes they get and see the posts, along with the number of likes and dislikes they get on each post and the images they convert.
