#### Project Description: 
As part of the Web 3.0 evolution, NFT has become a popular topic for tech enthusiasts to discuss and invest in. With the NFT trend proliferating, mosaic art style images have become a fashion for people to use as their profile photos for their social media accounts. 

For this project, I'm interested in constructing a website that provides functionality for users to upload their images and convert their pictures to mosaic art-style images. Aside from converting the images, the website will also provide users with options to download the image or post the image on the online mosaic art style image community to share with other users and comment under the posts.

The website will consist of Oauth Login function for new users to login with their Google accounts. An image conversion page converts the user-uploaded images to mosaic art-style pictures. And also a community page where users are able to post and comment on others' pictures. If time allows, we are thinking of using different APIs that apply filters, and other art styles to images users upload to provide users with more choices of the types of images they want to convert.
